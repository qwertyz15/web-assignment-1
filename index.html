        <p>
          I'm an experienced software engineer who constantly seeks out
          innovative solutions to everyday problems. In my seven years in this
          industry, I've honed my analytical thinking and collaboration skills,
          and I love working with a team. I've also had the opportunity to serve
          as the software engineer lead for three projects with First
          Technology.

          <h3>Mission</h3>
          <p>
            I employed by a company who needs software solutions for their
            business needs (be it a software developer company, a bank, an
            engineering company, a distribution business, whatever…) I work
            there trying to create software solutions for the needs of the
            company.

            alt="no-image-found"
          />
          <h3>Vision</h3>
          <p>
            I may decide to pursue further studies and be a researcher who
            continues to contribute to academia by teaching and to the knowledge
            by researching unknown solutions for existing technical, real life
            or business problems.

          />
          <h3>Goal</h3>
          <p>
            I create a solution for a real life problem or a business problem,
            makes a business out of it, and creates an enterprise which runs a
            business by providing a software solution for a business problem.

        <p>
          You’re tired of second-guessing if your professional development
          efforts are meeting the mark. You’re ready to build the professional
          learning your people need in order to be effective with young people.
          Time is of the essence. Young people need high-quality programming now
          more than ever. Your funders and partners are requesting your
          services. Now you must ensure that the teams on the ground have the
          knowledge and skills they need for successful implementation. Without
          a clear system of high-quality training and support, your
          youth-focused initiative may not sustain. Great staff could leave.
          Your program won’t reach as many young people as it could.
